Business-OnlinePayment-StoredTransaction version 0.01
=====================================================

This module uses the Business::OnlinePayment interface to safely (I hope) store
creditcard information.  This information can be later retrieved using the
Business::OnlinePayment::StoredTransaction::Unstore module and batch processed,
manually processed, etc.

Note: I am not a cryptographer.  I believe my implementation is ok, but I
could be doing something really stupid.  You should probably have a real
crypto expert look at this if you need to use it for something important.
